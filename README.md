### InstaSolutions - LanguageTutor

LanguageTutor is a prototype project developed as part of the course Software Product and Process Management at Tampere University.

This project focuses on the management aspects of software development, including product planning, feature design, risk assessment, stakeholder analysis, and process management. It does not contain code, as the goal was to practice software product management rather than implementation.

Created a phased development plan with four milestones (MVP → Engagement → Gamification → Premium Features).

Conducted project-level risk assessment and mitigation strategies.

Applied agile and lean principles in planning and process design.

Practiced effort estimation, stakeholder management, and product lifecycle considerations.

### Motto

**"Ease language learning"** – helping learners quickly and efficiently acquire new languages with engaging and effective tools.
